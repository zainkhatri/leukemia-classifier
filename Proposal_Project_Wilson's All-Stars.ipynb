    "Our team is developing a medical AI system for early Leukemia detection that addresses a critical real-world challenge in healthcare. The project is working with over 3,000 blood cell images and complex image data. We're implementing a complete deep learning pipeline with model selection, uncertainty quantification, and multiple evaluation metrics. Rather than a toy problem, we're tackling a system that could have real clinical impact."

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project aims to develop an interpretable deep learning system for early detection and subtype classification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). We will be working with a dataset of 3,242 peripheral blood smear images collected from Taleqani Hospital, containing expert-validated labels for benign and three malignant subtypes (Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B ALL). We're building a custom CNN architecture that moves beyond simple classification by incorporating uncertainty quantification and visual explanations to help medical professionals understand and trust its decisions. Performance will be measured using not just accuracy metrics, but also through uncertainty calibration and interpretability measures to ensure real clinical utility.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our research focuses on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), an aggressive blood cancer requiring rapid diagnosis for optimal treatment outcomes<a name=\"terwilliger\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#terwilligernote). While manual microscopic examination remains the standard practice, it faces significant challenges with studies showing inter-observer variability rates up to 30%<a name=\"labati\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#labatinote).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've found that deep learning approaches show promise in addressing these challenges, with recent studies achieving over 90% accuracy in leukemia cell classification<a name=\"rehman\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#rehmannote). However, our research indicates a crucial gap - developing systems that provide interpretable results that clinicians can trust and incorporate into their decision-making process<a name=\"tonekaboni\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#tonekabininote).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key insight driving our approach is that uncertainty quantification in medical AI systems has emerged as crucial for clinical adoption, helping identify cases requiring additional expert review<a name=\"begoli\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#begolinote).\n"
